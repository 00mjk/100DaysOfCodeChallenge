# Day 23

I'm still playing with gradients, animation and keyframes. I explored more of radial gradients today while trying to mix it with animation and ended up making a semi-animated star system with one star and 5 planets and a lot of animated background stars (white dots made with box-shadow on a pseudo-element alternating their spread radius with animation and keyframes).

I'm impressed with what is possible to do with those properties given some creativity is in place. This actually inspired me to try to create a fully animated star system, with planets moving in their orbit paths and scintillating background stars.

I still want to try to create a few more gradient patterns, then I will move on to the animated solar system, and then, finally, proceed to the next lessons in FCC.
