Today I practiced a bit more with the position property to make sure I understand it, because it seems very important for building layouts.

I also learned about the `float` property and played with it in a test html document. I think this property is essential to building a good, symmetrical layout, especially a grid-like layout. It allows to build symmetrical columns and rows.
