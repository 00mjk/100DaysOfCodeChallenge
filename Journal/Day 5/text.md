# Day 5

I spent some time thinking of some pet project to start working towards and implement whatever I learn on it.

I think I will try something called Color Trivia, in which the website will give interesting trivia facts about colors and whatever cool stuff I come up with. I just needed a basic idea of something to build so I'm not limited to the "cat photo app" used during FCC lessons.

This will give me more opportunities to implement what I learn. I strongly believe "doing" is the best way of learning.

I think I have pretty good artistical eyes. I can tell if something is good design or not. I can make something look good, appealing and have an enjoyable experience. I truly believe that. I'm excited to learn whatever I need to create those websites.
