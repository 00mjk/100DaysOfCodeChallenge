# Day 1

Today I start this journey of coding for 100 days straight. This is especially interesting for me, because I was aimless and had a stagnating life for a long time and had a problem with procrastination. So I hope that this will keep me accountable and disciplined.

I'm starting the FCC curriculum from the beginning (html basics) and I plan to have a respectable knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies by the end of it. I will be updating the code as I progress through the roadmap.

I plan to have a project to build and update it as I learn more, but for now I don't really know what to build yet. I will think of something.

I decided to use Toggl to track the time I spent coding and also to make use of the pomodoro technique.

I expect do develop a strong habit of coding daily, leading me to develop a considerable working knowledge, enough to actually work in the industry and start developing real stuff for real people, while exploring more technologies in my free time.

So, I'm rushing through the basic stuff I already know -- basic html tags and css, html attributes, html and css structure and rules.

I will probably hit a roadblock once I get to the javascript part. Looking forward to it.
