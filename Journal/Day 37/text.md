# Day 37

## Studying offline

Not having internet at home is making the learning process a bit more challenging. It's demanding for some alternative study solutions. I've spent a couple days looking for ways to achieve complete offline learning. I have to be honest: there is no way to completely learn web-dev offline. The reason is because, eventually, the docs explanation won't be enough; or it will be confusing. You will want to explore other resources about the same concept, looking for different explanations. You might need to watch a YouTube video, read stackoverflow, read a blog's article etc.

However, my Internet access isn't completely off. Although I don't have it at home, I can still *conveniently* access nearby public Wi-Fis, temporarily, just to download a youtube video, or save a blog's webpage about a concept I'm not quite understanding. Also, I need the connection to tweet my progress.

So, I researched about offline docs and stumbled upon documentation software (which I wasn't even aware of its existence), and devdocs.io. I can't stress enough how important those will be for my learning journey from now on. Without them, I don't think I would be able to pull this off.

With access to Zeal and devdocs.io, I have, at my disposal, docs of pretty much any technology I'm learning at the moment and many others which I will need in the future.

I also have a local development environemnt setup with VSCode and the live-server extension.

I'm being able to do this mostly offline. I only have to use internet when I need to tweet or download a documentation from devdocs.io or Zeal; and sometimes to download a YouTube video, a blog's article etc.
