Funny, I just learned about :root in FCC, though I already learned about it when I was trying to understand custom CSS variables a few lessons ago. These two topics are very related, so it's no surprise that learning one leads to learning of the other.

Omg, I loved playing with the penguin's size and color features using `@media` (media queries) and global and local custom variables. Changing the `background-color` property, as well as the custom properties' values and seeing the penguin react dynamically to these changes.
