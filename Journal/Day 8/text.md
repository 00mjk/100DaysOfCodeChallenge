# Day 8

Today I thought I was stupid, cause I couldn't fully understand the `position: absolute;` and `position: relative;` rules. However, after researching other sources and watching YouTube videos on it, I completely understand how it works now and it feels really good to know you actually understand the inner workings of something.

The whole session was spent on this, but it was worth it. I don't want to move forward with holes in my knowledge. I need strong basics, strong fundamentals to make sure I will easily grasp the more advanced concepts.

It's also important to have these concepts well defined in my vocabulary for when I need to communicate it with other devs.

Also discovered I can mess around with the code in a live setting by going into the developer tools of my chrome browser and edit the code there.
