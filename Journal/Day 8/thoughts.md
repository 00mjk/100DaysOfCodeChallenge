# `position:absolute`, `position:relative`, `position: sticky` and `position:fixed`

## 

The `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties can be easily remembered as follows:
The element being affected by these properties and the properties themselves can be imagined as magnets, where the properties have the opposite pole and are always repelling the element. So if you set top to 10px, the element will move 10px away from the top property, essentially moving down.

If you use negative values to these properties, then the opposite happens, the element will be "attracted" to that side. E.g.: Setting the top to -10px, will make the element move TOWARDS that side, essentially moving up.
