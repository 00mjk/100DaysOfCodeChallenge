Practiced building a grid layout. Had problems centering a group of floating buttons. Discovered at least 3 possible solutions to centre those, using `display: table;` along `margin: 0 auto;` in the parent container; using flexbox; and using inline-block instead of float and using `font-size: 0` in the parent container to remove the whitespace generated by the inline-block.
