# Day 29

## Animated Star System

I changed the color of some stars and added a lot more stars (there's a hundred of them now), I want to make this part of space look very crowded as I think it looks better.

I also added a wrapper div to the star system elements (system's star, planets and orbit lines), and added a transform property to this div to adjust the scale() function. I wanted to decrease the scale so that more of the star system could be visible.
