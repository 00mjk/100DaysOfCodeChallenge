# Day 22

I spent the day reading and practicing gradient patterns for backgrounds.

Today I lost access to Internet, for an indefinite amount of time. Financial reasons. I will have to work a bit harder to keep my web-dev and 100DaysOfChallenge journey, but I won't stop. I want to learn this, no matter what. I've finally found something I genuinely enjoy doing that can have financial returns in the future, this is like "my thing". I get to be creative, analytical, have fun and even make a living out of it, eventually? Not having internet access won't stop me. The key is adaptation. We humans survived through adaptation (and cooperation), and that's what I will do.
