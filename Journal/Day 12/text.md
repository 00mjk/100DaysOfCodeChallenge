# Day 12

Not much today. I'm still practicing and experimenting with grid layouts. Now I'm building a navbar on the top of the page that sticks itself there, using the same principles -- inline-block level elements inside div containers with font-align and vertical-align to centralize the child elements.

The color choices aren't really definite, I just wanted to have different colors in different areas of the elements (border, content etc.) to know exactly what is going on in the page. Even the borders in most of the elements are there just so I know exactly what the padding, margin, border etc. looks like, it's like a draft, in which you remove the "guiding" lines after you're done with the drawing.
