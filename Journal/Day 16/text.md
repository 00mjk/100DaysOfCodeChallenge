# Day 16

I was looking through some good-looking websites and trying to replicate some of the elements. I decided to try to replicate the right-arrow button in the carrousel at [this page](https://tazoselmachips.com.br/) and also the "Compre agora" button below the carrousel.

The right-arrow button is a PNG image, so it was probably drawn in a image-editing software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator and then placed in the html document as the url() parameter for the background property. I don't know, yet, how to make that arrow shape, so I used the Win10 snipping tool to cut an image of the arrow shape and placed as the background-image property for the purple circles.

The "Compre agora" button was actually drawn using CSS.

I was able to replicate both of them and ended up learning a trick to make a multiple borders illusion and a how to make a border with a transparent gap between itself and the element content.

I really like learning like this -- trying to replicate features of a great website. It's like indirectly learning with more experienced devs.
