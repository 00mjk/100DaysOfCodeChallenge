# Day 28

I started making background stars and animated falling stars in my animated star system.

I decided to make a div for each individual star as this gives me more control over every single one of them. Also, I'm thinking about making another div for different groups of stars -- a wrapper div for 4 stars, another wrapper for 6 stars, and so on, for different quantities. This will give me another angle of control over them, because I might need to do something to a certain group of adjacent stars without affecting the properties of other nearby groups of surrounding stars.

What do I plan to do with separated group of stars? I don't know, but better make the code "prepared" for any future ideas I might have. I think it's a good practice and a good habit to develop.
