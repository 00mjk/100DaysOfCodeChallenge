# Day 25

Continuing the animated star system.

I added some layers of box-shadow to the star to give some lights effects. I also animated the "light" blur and spread radius to make it look like it's "alive".

Before moving on, I want to make sure I will be able to make the planets rotate counter-clockwise and elliptically around the star, while also adjusting the z-index on the fly to make the planet look like it's behind the sun when it's supposed to. I want to make it look really 3D.

I'm having trouble figuring out how to make the planet move along the elliptic orbit lines.
