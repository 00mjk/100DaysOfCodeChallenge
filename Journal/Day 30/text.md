# Day 30

Today I changed the planets' texture, to make them look a bit more interesting (read: less boring). I also added a "disk" or "ring" (I don't remember the actual name and I have no Internet here) to one of the planets, similar to Saturn. I also added a "tail" to the falling stars.

People on Twitter love this project. I would work more on it, but I have to keep learning new things. I need to progress on the roadmap to become a web-dev. Maybe, in the future, when I learn more, I will come back to this and improve it.
